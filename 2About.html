                    <h3>Favorite Quote <i class="fa-regular fa-comment"></i></h3>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"Impossible? We did a lot of impossible things on this journey. I'm tired of hearing that things are impossible or useless. Those words mean nothing to us." - Jotaro Kujo</p>
                    <p>This quote is my favorite because it teaches us to reject self-limiting beliefs and embrace a mindset of perseverance by proving "impossible" tasks can be overcome through effort and experience.</p>
                    <p>-------------------------------------</p>
                    <p>"In the face of adversity, we must find the strength to keep moving forward." - Jotaro Kujo</p>
                    <p>I like this quote because it shows perseverance and resilience are more important than immediate success.</p>
